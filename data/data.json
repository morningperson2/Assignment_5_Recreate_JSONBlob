It was McCartney's fifth album after leaving the Beatles in April 1970. Although sales were modest initially, its commercial performance was aided by two hit singles – \"Jet\" and \"Band on the Run\" – such that it became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia, in addition to revitalising McCartney's critical standing. It remains McCartney's most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works."

	  "description": "Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on May 16, 1966 by Capitol Records. It was initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Top LPs chart. In the United Kingdom, the album was lauded by critics and reached number 2 on the Record Retailer chart, remaining in the top ten for six months. Promoted there as \"the most progressive pop album ever\", Pet Sounds was recognized for its ambitious production, sophisticated music, and emotional lyrics. It is considered to be among the greatest and most influential albums in music history.[1]\n\nThe album was produced, arranged, and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist Tony Asher. It was recorded largely between January and April 1966, a year after Wilson had quit touring with his bandmates and debuted a more progressive sound with The Beach Boys Today!. Wilson viewed Pet Sounds as effectively a solo album and credited part of its inspiration to marijuana and a newfound spiritual enlightenment. Galvanized by the work of his idol Phil Spector and rival group the Beatles, his goal was to create \"the greatest rock album ever made\", one without filler. An early concept album, it consists mainly of introspective and semi-autobiographical songs like \"You Still Believe in Me\", about a lover's unwavering loyalty, \"I Know There's an Answer\", a critique of LSD users, and \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", about social alienation."

The album peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, number 9 on the Canadian RPM Albums Chart and number 15 on the Billboard 200."
